# Grid#Shortcut **v1.4.0**

This is a mod for Crusader King 3 (**v1.1.1**) that adds more than four hundred shortcuts to the game. The idea is to speed up interface interactions by diminishing the mouse usage with scoped shortcuts. They are scoped to the window that is opened, allowing the coverage of many different actions with same hotkeys.

The most frequent actions are mapped with easy-to-reach thinking, meaning they are mapped to the left side of the keyboard, where the hand rests, by the keys: 1-5, QWERT, ASDFG, ZXCVB, TAB and SPACE. The more uncommon actions (map view and few windows), are mapped to sequences which is usually initiated by SPACE. This configuration should help decreasing the mouse usage, allowing you to even combo hotkeys. Just keep in mind that there is a learning curve, since it requires memorization.

# Requirement

Since CK3 still don't support modding the file "*Crusader King III/game/gui/shorcuts.shortcuts*", you will have to replace your version with [mine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qqcUODmwOF2NYtI87KutyU6J7tDeV5dm/view?usp=sharing) manually, otherwise the hotkeys won't work. 

**NOTE: When updating your mod version, you must again manually update the 'shortcuts.shortcuts'.**

# Mods integrated
- [Extended Outliner](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2219611817): Amazing quality of life mod which was added and slightly modified to display income and war status of pinned characters. The 'cycling through armies' shortcut was added to it as well. Thanks 'Fun' for developing it; please don't forget to upvote his mod.

# Hotkeys Guide
Right below you can learn every mapping added by this mod. Fortunately, most hotkeys you can also discover in-game by hovering buttons, but some just won't show up, like the opening portraits ones. For that, it is recommended to check the list below from time to time, while playing.

## General Idea
Hotkeys can be either global or window-scoped, meaning they change based on the window that is opened. The global ones should not be difficult to learn, but the scoped ones might be tricky. However, in order to ease memorization, the hotkeys were constructed with some logic in mind, which you can follow in the list below. Reading this a few times should get you going. 

| Key | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1, 2, 3, 4 | Navigate between tabs |
| SPACE | Start sequential global hotkeys  |
| ESCAPE | Cancel most actions |
| E | Confirm most actions. Also more related to positive actions |
| Q | Decline most actions. Also more related to negative actions | 
| F | Open portraits, and toggle most checkboxes | 
| G | Open portraits, and create / Destroy items | 
| V | Grant land/title to vassal |
| R | Open county/character religion. Also open elections |
| T | Open county/character culture. |
| B | Navigate one step back |

## Global hotkeys
Below you can check all the available global hotkeys. Many of them are bound to sequences, which are keys you must press 
in a giving order with no more than one second of interval. For example, to pause the game you must press PAUSE, then PAUSE again. Such kind of hotkey will be noted in the following pattern through all the guide: 

```
PAUSE > PAUSE
```
